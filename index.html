                                    of the most important steps to ensure that your lithium battery delivers maximum
                                    performance.</p>

                                <button class="btn-watch" data-video-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DSbMtZ9ZYaU">

                                <h3>1. Remove the battery from the tool</h3>
                                <p>Press the release buttons firmly and slide the battery out. Charging the battery
                                    outside the tool prevents accidental activation and ensures proper temperature
                                    control during the process.</p>

                                <h3>2. Use only the original charger included in your kit</h3>
                                <p>Each charger is designed to deliver the correct voltage and current for its specific
                                    battery model. Using incompatible chargers can overload the cells, cause
                                    overheating, or drastically reduce battery life.</p>

                                <h3>3. Charge the battery fully before using the tool for the first time</h3>
                                <p>Connect the battery to the charger until the indicator light displays a full charge.
                                    A complete first charge helps the internal management system calibrate and ensures
                                    the battery reaches its intended storage and working capacity.</p>

                                <h3>4. Do not interrupt the first charge cycle</h3>
                                <p>Avoid removing the battery before the initial charge is complete. Interrupting the
                                    first cycle may lead to inaccurate calibration and reduce the battery’s ability to
                                    hold charge over time.</p>

                                <h3>5. Allow the battery to rest before use</h3>
                                <p>After removing it from the charger, let the battery sit for approximately 5 minutes.
                                    This resting period allows the internal cells to stabilize their temperature and
                                    voltage before being placed under load.</p>

                                <h3>Essential Guidelines to Maximize Lithium Battery Lifespan</h3>
                                <p>Lithium batteries are highly efficient and durable when used correctly. Following the
                                    recommendations below will significantly extend their operating life and protect
                                    their charging capacity.</p>

                                <h3>1. Avoid deep discharges whenever possible</h3>
                                <p>Lithium batteries do not need to be drained completely. Allowing the charge to drop
                                    below 20 percent repeatedly increases internal stress and accelerates aging of the
                                    cells.</p>

                                <h3>2. Do not leave the battery charging for long periods after it reaches 100 percent
                                </h3>
                                <p>Although lithium batteries have internal protection circuits, prolonged overcharging
                                    generates unnecessary heat, which gradually degrades the cells.</p>

                                <h3>3. Store the battery under the right conditions</h3>
                                <p>If you plan to store the battery for several weeks or months:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Keep it between 40 and 60 percent charge.</li>
                                    <li>Store it in a cool, dry environment.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid any temperature above 35°C or below 0°C.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Extreme temperatures are one of the main causes of premature battery deterioration.
                                </p>

                                <h3>4. Use the battery regularly</h3>
                                <p>Lithium batteries benefit from periodic use. If the tool stays unused, the battery
                                    may enter deep sleep mode, reducing its responsiveness. Running the tool briefly
                                    every few weeks helps keep the cells active.</p>

                                <h3>5. Keep battery contacts clean and free of debris</h3>
                                <p>Use a dry cloth to clean the metal contacts occasionally. Dust, grease, or oxidation
                                    can interfere with energy transfer and slow down charging.</p>

                                <h3>6. Allow the battery to cool before charging</h3>
                                <p>Charging a hot battery causes chemical stress and increases internal resistance,
                                    reducing the number of usable cycles. If the battery warms up during use, let it
                                    cool to room temperature before attaching it to the charger.</p>

                                <h3>7. Protect the battery from moisture and impacts</h3>
                                <p>Water, oil, or cleaning products can damage the internal circuit board and
                                    permanently affect battery safety. Also avoid drops or strong impacts, as lithium
                                    cells are sensitive to deformation.</p>

                                <h3>1. Identify the torque control system of your impact wrench</h3>
                                <p>Most models offer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Multiple speed levels</li>
                                    <li>Torque presets</li>
                                    <li>Variable trigger pressure for fine control</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Understanding these settings will help you adjust the tool accurately.</p>

                                <h3>2. Choose the correct torque level for your task</h3>
                                <p><strong>Low torque:</strong> ideal for small screws, delicate materials, and assembly
                                    work where precision is important.</p>
                                <p><strong>Medium torque:</strong> recommended for automotive tasks, household repairs,
                                    and general fastening.</p>
                                <p><strong>High torque:</strong> used for heavy-duty applications such as loosening
                                    tight bolts, construction work, and rusted or seized fasteners.</p>

                                <h3>3. Start with a lower torque setting</h3>
                                <p>When working on unfamiliar materials or hardware, begin at the lowest power level.
                                    Gradually increase until the screw or bolt is tightened securely without
                                    over-tightening.</p>

                                <h3>4. Avoid excessive torque</h3>
                                <p>Applying too much torque can damage threads, crack components, or make future removal
                                    difficult. Use proper socket sizes and always keep the tool aligned with the
                                    fastener to prevent slipping.</p>

                                <h3>5. Test torque on a sample piece when possible</h3>
                                <p>If you are working on sensitive materials or new parts, test the torque setting on a
                                    spare piece before applying it to the final job.</p>

                                <h3>How to Set the Correct Power Supply for Different Types of Work</h3>

                                <h3>1. Understand your tool’s power system</h3>
                                <p>Depending on the model, your impact wrench may operate on lithium-ion battery packs
                                    or external power adapters. Most modern impact wrenches rely on rechargeable
                                    batteries, so proper battery management is essential.</p>

                                <h3>2. For small or medium tasks, use a partially charged battery</h3>
                                <p>For light work such as furniture assembly or general home use, a battery between 50%
                                    and 80% is sufficient. This helps preserve long-term battery health while still
                                    delivering consistent performance.</p>

                                <h3>3. For heavy-duty jobs, ensure a fully charged battery</h3>
                                <p>Tasks like removing wheel nuts, working on machinery, or loosening rusted bolts
                                    require maximum power output. Always start with a fully charged battery for these
                                    situations to avoid power drops during operation.</p>

                                <h3>4. Avoid using the tool when the battery is below 20%</h3>
                                <p>Low voltage reduces torque, causes the tool to strain, and accelerates battery wear.
                                    Recharge once the battery reaches approximately 20–30%.</p>

                                <h3>5. Use the correct charger and allow full charge cycles</h3>
                                <p>The original charger provides the exact voltage and current your battery requires.
                                    Using third-party chargers may lead to overheating, inconsistent power delivery, or
                                    long-term damage.</p>

                                <h3>6. Keep a spare battery for uninterrupted work</h3>
                                <p>If you frequently work on heavy jobs or long projects, having a second battery
                                    ensures continuous power. Alternate between batteries to maintain healthy charge
                                    cycles.</p>

                                <h3>7. Store batteries properly when not in use</h3>
                                <p>Keep the battery between 40% and 60% charge, away from heat, moisture, or direct
                                    sunlight. Correct storage guarantees safer and more efficient operation during
                                    future tasks.</p>

                                <h3>2. Choose the Correct Socket Size</h3>
                                <p>Always select a socket that fits tightly onto the bolt or nut. Loose-fitting sockets
                                    can cause slipping, rounding of bolts, or accidents. Make sure the socket is
                                    properly locked onto the tool before starting.</p>

                                <h3>3. Set the Direction of Rotation</h3>
                                <p>Use the forward/reverse switch to choose:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Forward (tightening)</li>
                                    <li>Reverse (loosening)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Always check the direction before pulling the trigger.</p>

                                <h3>4. Adjust Speed and Torque Levels</h3>
                                <p>Your impact wrench may offer multiple modes or speed settings. Use them as follows:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Low speed / low torque:</strong> Furniture, small screws, delicate
                                        materials</li>
                                    <li><strong>Medium speed:</strong> Automotive tasks, general household repairs</li>
                                    <li><strong>High speed / high torque:</strong> Wheel nuts, construction bolts,
                                        rusted or tight fasteners</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Start with a lower setting and increase only if necessary. Overtightening can damage
                                    threads or components.</p>

                                <h3>5. Proper Grip and Positioning</h3>
                                <p>Hold the tool firmly with both hands when possible. Keep your wrist aligned with the
                                    bolt to prevent slipping. Position the socket straight onto the fastener to ensure
                                    efficient torque transfer.</p>

                                <h3>6. Use Short Controlled Bursts</h3>
                                <p>Instead of holding the trigger continuously, apply short bursts: This gives you
                                    better control and prevents overtightening.</p>

                                <h3>7. Remove the Fastener Carefully</h3>
                                <p>When loosening bolts, keep the tool aligned. As soon as the fastener is free, release
                                    the trigger to avoid spinning it out unexpectedly.</p>

                                <h3>8. Check Bolt Tightness with a Torque Wrench (Optional)</h3>
                                <p>For critical applications such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Car wheels</li>

                        <h3>1. Maintain a stable stance</h3>
                        <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart to keep balance and prevent unwanted movement while
                            operating the tool.</p>

                        <h3>2. Hold the tool firmly</h3>
                        <p>Use a steady, comfortable grip on the handle. Keep your wrist straight to avoid strain and to
                            improve control of the impact wrench.</p>

                        <h3>3. Align the tool with the fastener</h3>
                        <p>Position the socket perfectly straight over the bolt or nut. Proper alignment ensures full
                            torque transfer and reduces the risk of slipping or damaging the fastener.</p>

                        <h3>4. Support with the other hand when needed</h3>
                        <p>For high-torque tasks or tight spaces, use your free hand to stabilize the front of the tool
                            for better precision and control.</p>

                        <h3>5. Let the tool do the work</h3>
                        <p>Avoid applying sideways pressure or forcing the tool forward. Simply hold it in place and
                            allow the impact mechanism to deliver the necessary power.</p>

                    <div class="instruction-text">
                        <h3>1. Understand the tool’s work cycle</h3>
                        <p>Impact wrenches are designed to operate in short, controlled bursts rather than continuous
                            use. A typical work cycle involves applying torque for a few seconds, followed by a brief
                            rest period. This prevents overheating and ensures consistent performance.</p>

                        <h3>2. Avoid prolonged continuous operation</h3>
                        <p>Using the tool nonstop for long periods can cause excess heat in the motor, gearbox, and
                            battery. Always limit each operation to short intervals, especially when working with high
                            torque loads or stubborn fasteners.</p>

                        <h3>3. Allow proper cooling time</h3>
                        <p>If the tool becomes warm during use, pause for several minutes to let it cool down naturally.
                            Forced cooling (like placing it near fans or in cold environments) is not recommended, as
                            rapid temperature changes may affect internal components.</p>

                        <h3>4. Monitor battery temperature</h3>
                        <p>Lithium batteries can heat up during demanding tasks. If the battery becomes hot, remove it
                            and allow it to cool before charging or reinstalling. Operating or charging a hot battery
                            reduces its lifespan and may damage internal cells.</p>

                        <h3>5. Respect usage limits for heavy-duty tasks</h3>
                        <p>When working on jobs that require maximum power, such as loosening tight or rusted bolts, use
                            the tool in short bursts. Overloading the tool by holding the trigger continuously can
                            strain both the motor and impact mechanism.</p>

                        <h3>6. Alternate tasks to prevent overheating</h3>
                        <p>If performing multiple high-torque operations, switch between heavy and light tasks to allow
                            the tool and battery to recover gradually.</p>

                        <h3>7. Stop immediately if you notice performance drop</h3>
                        <p>A sudden decrease in torque, unusual noise, or increased vibration may indicate overheating.
                            Pause use and allow the tool to cool before continuing.</p>

                        <h3>Tool Lubrication: Importance, Frequency, and Proper Application</h3>
                        <p>Proper lubrication is essential to keep your impact wrench running smoothly, extend its
                            lifespan, and ensure consistent performance during demanding tasks. Internal components such
                            as the hammer mechanism, bearings, and moving parts rely on adequate lubrication to reduce
                            friction and prevent premature wear. Understanding how and when to lubricate your tool is an
                            important part of maintaining its long-term reliability.</p>

                        <h3>1. Why lubrication matters</h3>
                        <p>The internal hammering system of an impact wrench generates high levels of force and rapid
                            movement. Without proper lubrication, this friction increases significantly, which can lead
                            to overheating, loss of power, and accelerated component wear. Regular lubrication keeps the
                            parts moving freely and improves efficiency during operation.</p>

                        <h3>2. Identify lubrication points</h3>
                        <p>Most impact wrenches include designated areas where lubrication should be applied, such as
                            the anvil, hammer mechanism, and sometimes the front housing. Always check your model’s
                            manual to confirm the correct lubrication points and recommended grease type.</p>

                        <h3>3. Use the correct lubricant</h3>
                        <p>Impact wrenches require high-quality, high-temperature grease specifically designed for
                            impact mechanisms. Using the wrong type of lubricant can break down under heavy loads or
                            cause internal clogging. Avoid oils or lightweight greases unless explicitly recommended by
                            the manufacturer.</p>

                        <h3>4. How often to lubricate</h3>
                        <p>Frequency depends on usage:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequent or heavy-duty use: lubricate every few weeks or after large projects</li>
                            <li>Moderate use: lubricate every 1–2 months</li>
                            <li>Occasional use: lubricate every 3–6 months</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the tool begins making unusual noises, feels rough during operation, or loses efficiency,
                            lubrication may be needed sooner.</p>

                        <h3>5. Steps for proper lubrication</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disconnect the tool from the battery before servicing</li>
                            <li>Remove the front housing or access cover (if applicable)</li>
                            <li>Clean dust or old grease from visible areas using a dry cloth</li>
                            <li>Apply a small amount of recommended grease directly onto the moving parts</li>
                            <li>Reassemble the tool securely before use</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Avoid over-lubricating, as excess grease can trap dust and reduce performance.</p>

                        <h3>6. Keep the anvil lightly lubricated</h3>
                        <p>The anvil—the square drive where sockets attach—experiences constant friction. Apply a small
                            layer of grease occasionally to ensure smooth socket engagement and prevent rust.</p>

                        <h3>7. Watch for signs of poor lubrication</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unusual grinding noises</li>
                            <li>Reduced torque or slower performance</li>
                            <li>Excessive heat during short work cycles</li>
                            <li>Increased vibration</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If any of these signs appear, stop using the tool and inspect lubrication before continuing.
                        </p>

                        <h3>8. Store the tool properly after lubrication</h3>
                        <p>After servicing, store the impact wrench in a dry environment to prevent grease
                            contamination. Keeping dust and moisture away preserves both the internal mechanism and the
                            lubrication itself.</p>

                            <p>Keep ventilation openings free of debris to prevent overheating.</p>

                            <h3>5. Clean the anvil area carefully</h3>
                            <p>Wipe around the anvil and socket connection point to remove dust, grease buildup, or
                                metal shavings.</p>
                            <p>Do not insert liquids or sprays inside the tool.</p>

                            <h3>6. Dry the tool completely before reassembly</h3>
                            <p>Make sure no moisture remains on the surface before reinstalling the battery.</p>

                            <h3>7. Store the tool in a clean, dry environment</h3>
                            <p>After cleaning, place the impact wrench in its case or storage area to protect it from
                                dust, humidity, and accidental impacts.</p>

                        <h2>How to Properly Store Your Impact Wrench</h2>
                        <div class="instruction-text">
                            <p>Correct storage is essential to preserve the performance, safety, and durability of your
                                impact wrench. Following these guidelines helps protect the tool and its battery from
                                damage caused by moisture, dust, and improper handling.</p>

                            <h3>1. Remove the battery before storage</h3>
                            <p>Always detach the battery from the tool when storing it. This prevents accidental
                                activation and protects the battery contacts.</p>

                            <h3>2. Clean the tool before storing</h3>
                            <p>Make sure the exterior is free of dust, grease, and debris. A clean tool is less likely
                                to develop corrosion or long-term wear.</p>

                            <h3>3. Store in a dry and ventilated place</h3>
                            <p>Choose a location that is clean, dry, and away from moisture or direct sunlight. Excess
                                humidity can damage internal components and electrical contacts.</p>

                            <h3>4. Avoid extreme temperatures</h3>
                            <p>Do not store the impact wrench in very hot or very cold environments. Extreme
                                temperatures can affect both the tool’s internal components and battery lifespan.</p>

                            <h3>5. Store the battery correctly</h3>
                            <p>If the battery will not be used for an extended period, store it separately with a charge
                                level between 40% and 60%. This helps maintain battery health and prevents capacity
                                loss.</p>

                            <h3>6. Use the original case or protective storage</h3>
                            <p>Whenever possible, store the impact wrench in its original case or a protective box. This
                                prevents dust accumulation and protects the tool from impacts.</p>

                            <h3>7. Keep the tool away from heavy objects</h3>
                            <p>Do not place heavy items on top of the tool or its case. Excess pressure may damage the
                                housing or internal components.</p>

                            <h3>8. Check the tool periodically</h3>
                            <p>If the tool is stored for long periods, inspect it occasionally and briefly power it on
                                to ensure proper operation.</p>
